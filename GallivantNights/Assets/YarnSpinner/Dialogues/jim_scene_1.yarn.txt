Heya kid.
I heard you had some heartbreak with your lady friend. 
Sorry to hear about that.
How are you holding up?

Jim is an old junker.
He has been here at least as long as I have been alive.
Since I was a kid i have been coming here to buy part at cheaper rates than the higher end stores.
His parts may be cheaper but they are the best human engineered parts around.
