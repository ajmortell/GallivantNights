# GallivantNights
A cyber-horror thriller. An homage to games like Snatcher and Super Spy-hunter.

We have added a small tech demo that allows you to use yarn to make animated panels along with your text/options.

# To use simply..
1.  Open the file in Assets/Scenes called DialogueScene
2. Once in unity navigate to the folder structure and look in Assets/Prefabs/Animations/Scenes/...
 A) this is where the animated panels we have set up are located.
3. Next load up yarn and find the scene_0.yarn file in the Assets/Yarnspinner/Dialogues folder and see how the commands are used
4. Next we have the DialogueManager (Assets/Scripts/Dialogue) where most of the commands are located.
5. Note how everything is hooked up to the Dialogue object in the hierarchy.
6. Don't forget that each NPC scenes needs to be noted in the AnimatedEntity script in the inspector.
7. Also remember that each NPC has states that must be added as parameters to transition in the animator.
8. It is not perfect in its distilled form but it can be used to make whatever you want. 
9. Give credit where credit is due but if you obliterate the code and make something new all power to you of course.
10. Everything else is standard yarn functionality most of which is in the the current yarnspinner tutorial demo.

# I hope you enjoy making animated text adventures and that this inspires or helps you with your own project.
